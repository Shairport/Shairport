# Overall Description of Project: <br>

To access the website, students would have to log on with their USC NetID. This is for privacy and also safety reasons as lyfting or ubering with random people who do not go to USC could be a major liability. Once the user logs in, the user can search for a ‘Shairport ride.’ The user can then input the necessary information for their trip: the date they are leaving for the airport, which airport and terminal they are going to, what time their flight is, their preferred time to leave, how many other people they prefer to ride with. After inputting this info, the website will show the current Shairport rides that closely match the user’s preferred criteria. If the user thinks one of the current rides is a good fit, they can “add” themselves to the group. After “adding” themselves to the group, they can get the other people’s contact info. If there are no Shairport rides that are a good fit for the user, the website will prompt the user to create a new Shairport ride ticket. When other users join the Shairport ride, the others in the ride will be notified.
